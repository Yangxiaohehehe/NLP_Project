    "required_knowledge": "Polar bears (Arctic, marine carnivores) and Herons (temperate/tropical, freshwater waders) do not naturally co-habitate or exhibit cooperative hunting behavior, as they are separated geographically and ecologically. The interaction is likely incidental in captivity.",
    "golden_answer": "No, this observation does not align with natural behavior. These species are geographically isolated (Arctic vs. temperate/tropical) and have incompatible diets. The suggested 'cooperative hunting' is contrary to their instincts and is likely an anthropomorphic interpretation of an incidental interaction in a zoo environment."

    "required_knowledge": "Steam engines rely on converting heat into mechanical work through an external combustion process (external combustion engine), which is inherently less efficient than modern diesel/electric engines. The premise of thermal superiority is false, regardless of the fuel used.",
    "golden_answer": "This premise is incorrect. The thermal efficiency of steam engines is fundamentally lower than modern internal combustion (diesel) or electric engines, regardless of fuel. Steam engines are external combustion engines that suffer from high heat loss, making them thermodynamically inferior for modern transport efficiency."

    "required_knowledge": "Grass-fed beef is nutritionally superior in certain aspects, particularly containing higher levels of Omega-3 fatty acids and Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) than grain-fed beef. The premise that grass-fed is 'lacking' a nutritional component is often reversed in popular health literature.",
    "golden_answer": "The premise is based on a common misconception. Grass-fed beef is typically higher in beneficial nutrients, specifically Omega-3 fatty acids and Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA), compared to grain-fed beef. Therefore, the grass-fed product would be richer, not lacking, these components."

    "required_knowledge": "Leaning into the turn helps counter centrifugal force, but the total normal force (downward vertical force) on the tires remains approximately equal to the combined weight of the bike and rider. The lean primarily affects the required *sideways* friction, not the *vertical* normal force.",
    "golden_answer": "Leaning primarily affects the horizontal forces required for turning (friction) and **does not significantly increase or decrease the vertical normal force** (which is essentially the combined weight). The normal force remains roughly constant, while the lean reduces the required sideways frictional force."

    "required_knowledge": "Giant breeds (Great Danes) are highly susceptible to hip/elbow dysplasia and Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM). High-tension/high-impact toys and repetitive, strenuous activity should be strictly limited and managed by a vet to prevent joint damage.",
    "golden_answer": "No, the owner should strictly limit this activity. Great Danes are genetically prone to severe hip dysplasia and heart issues (DCM). High-tension, repetitive jumping/fetching exacerbates joint damage and should be avoided or limited to very short, low-impact sessions as directed by a veterinarian."

    "question": "Analyze the skateboarder's technique: If the average air temperature is 85°F (30°C), what specific physiological benefit does wearing thick, high-cut striped socks provide to prevent muscular fatigue during this high-impact maneuver?",
    "required_knowledge": "Thick, high socks provide zero physiological benefit for fatigue prevention in hot weather (85°F). In fact, they trap heat and accelerate dehydration and muscle fatigue. The socks are worn purely for style/aesthetics.",
    "golden_answer": "There is no physiological benefit. Wearing thick, high-cut socks in 85°F weather will trap heat, restrict blood flow slightly, and accelerate dehydration, thereby *increasing* the risk of muscular fatigue. The choice to wear them is purely aesthetic, not performance-driven."

    "question": "If a government agency decided to shift this species' (Gull) primary food source from marine life to human garbage, predict the resulting long-term change in the gull's average wingspan and beak length over three generations.",
    "required_knowledge": "Gulls that shift to human food sources (garbage dumps) develop shorter beaks (suited for grabbing small items) and shorter wingspans (suited for sharp turns in urban environments), demonstrating rapid evolutionary adaptation.",
    "golden_answer": "The change would favor shorter features. Gulls that rely on human refuse (trash) develop, over generations, significantly shorter beaks (no longer needing long beaks for deep-sea diving) and shorter wingspans, as shorter wings are more efficient for maneuvering in tighter urban/land environments."

    "required_knowledge": "Running on uneven, slippery surfaces (like algae-covered rock) places extreme, sudden stress on canine joints, tendons, and ligaments. This activity should be strictly avoided or limited to less than five minutes, especially for dogs not conditioned for it.",
    "golden_answer": "This activity should be strictly avoided or limited to less than five minutes. The uneven, wet, and slippery surface creates a high risk of catastrophic tendon tears, ligament strains, and joint luxation due to uncontrolled landings and sudden, unstable movements."

    "question": "The surfer is an avid conservationist. If he were to modify his surfboard to be twice as long and half as wide, how would this change impact the total thrust force generated by the wave, assuming the wave's energy remains constant?",
    "required_knowledge": "Surfboard thrust is highly dependent on the area of the board exposed to the water/wave face. Changing the dimensions to double the length and halve the width would result in the same total area, meaning the total thrust force would remain approximately constant.",
    "golden_answer": "The total thrust force would remain approximately constant. Thrust is proportional to the board's surface area interacting with the wave. Since doubling the length while halving the width maintains the same total surface area, the overall force exerted by the wave should be largely unchanged."

    "required_knowledge": "The dog's low, intense crouch is a classic 'Stalk' posture of a Border Collie. The sheep's confirmation is their movement: they should be clustered tightly (Look/Stalk) and show a unified movement response (Push) only when the dog slightly raises its head.",
    "golden_answer": "The sheep must exhibit **tight clustering** and **unified movement**. The dog is demonstrating the 'Stalk' phase, which requires the sheep to be tightly gathered. The success of the 'Push' phase is confirmed when the sheep move as a single, coherent unit in response to the dog's subtle head lift or forward motion."

    "required_knowledge": "Visible soot often indicates inefficient combustion (running rich) or oil leaks. Regulatory bodies (FAA/EASA) mandate increased inspection intervals (e.g., borescope inspections) for components like fan blades and exhaust nozzles when abnormal combustion indicators, like soot, are present.",
    "golden_answer": "Visible soot indicates inefficient combustion or internal oil leakage. Regulatory bodies mandate an increase in inspection frequency, requiring more frequent borescope inspections of the internal fan blades, turbine blades, and exhaust nozzles to check for signs of carbon buildup or hot section damage."

    "golden_answer": "If the hand touches the ground as part of the initial catch or fall, it is **legal** and not a foul. The non-contact foul she is susceptible to is **Traveling** (if she moves her pivot foot immediately after establishing possession) or a **Foul Call** (if she contacts the defender illegally)."

    "required_knowledge": "Two-stroke engines are inherently non-compliant with modern EPA emissions standards due to their poor combustion efficiency and high hydrocarbon output. Compliance requires fundamental redesign (like direct injection), or the premise of compliance is false.",
    "golden_answer": "Two-stroke engines are highly polluting due to their design, making compliance with current EPA standards difficult. While modifications like direct injection exist, simply running a stock two-stroke engine in this manner is non-compliant; thus, the premise of easy compliance is false."

    "required_knowledge": "Storks primarily prey on amphibians (frogs, newts). A decrease in water depth will concentrate the prey population, leading to easier hunting and a rapid, unsustainable collapse of the local amphibian numbers.",
    "golden_answer": "The consequence would be rapid population collapse. Storks primarily prey on amphibians. A 10 cm annual decrease in water depth will concentrate the amphibian prey into smaller areas, drastically increasing the storks' hunting efficiency and leading to the unsustainable decimation of the local amphibian population."

    "golden_answer": "The high concentration of ripe bananas will significantly **accelerate** the ripening rate of the nearby climacteric fruits (avocados and tomatoes). Bananas produce large amounts of ethylene gas, which acts as a ripening hormone, causing premature softening and potential spoilage of the surrounding produce."

    "required_knowledge": "Safety standards in youth soccer (often dictated by AYSO/US Youth Soccer) mandate a specific distance (e.g., 2 yards or 6 feet) between the sideline and spectators/coaches to provide run-off space and prevent collisions.",
    "golden_answer": "Safety standards (such as those for youth soccer) generally mandate a minimum distance of **6 feet (approx. 2 yards)** between the sideline and all spectators or coaches. The adult walking immediately next to the sideline violates this safety standard by reducing the necessary run-off space."
