问题： what kinds of two birds
回答:['\nThe bird in the foreground is a Yellow Warbler, identifiable by its bright yellow plumage and distinctive black streaks on its head. The bird in the background appears to be a Great Egret, which is a large white egret with long legs and a long, sharp beak. The Great Egret is known for its elegant appearance and is often seen in wetlands and marshes.']
